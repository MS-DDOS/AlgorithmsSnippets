# Interesting Algorithms Snippets
This is just a collection of random python and C++ snippets that I wrote to help with analysis in my algorithms class. They are in most cases poorly documented but are actually pretty interesting to look at and determine their function. Most looked like pracitcal examples of dynamic programming for performance comparisons againsts brute force.
